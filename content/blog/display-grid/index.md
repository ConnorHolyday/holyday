Old IE is taking a back-seat thanks to todays ‚Äòevergreen‚Äô browsers. Hacking layouts with tables and floats are a thing of the past, and flexbox was never intended for full-page structure. (Just look at flexbugs)

There‚Äôs a new CSS Spec that‚Äôs set to revolutionise the way we build websites. From their overall layout ‚Äî all the way down to the component level. It‚Äôs landing in March 2017 for all modern browsers so it‚Äôll be around before you know it.

The current support in IE10, IE11, and Edge are referring to the old grid spec that will not be receiving any further updates. Although with Edge the new specification is currently labelled as ‚ÄúUnder Consideration‚Äù and you can track it‚Äôs progress [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/gridupdate/?q=grid%20update).

> But it‚Äôs so new! It‚Äôll be buggy just like flexbox _üòß_

CSS Grid has been in development for 5 years so it‚Äôs nothing new, you can place your trust in it. Although I would recommend using it with feature queries to progressively enhance your work. [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/01/03/css-grid-is-coming/) is an advocate that not everything has to look the same, and that browsers and devices can grow into your design.

## How it‚Äôs done

There will be some new CSS to learn, but it‚Äôs okay! You can start small and make some pretty smart grid-work. The more complex stuff can be dived into once you‚Äôre feeling more comfortable.

This is your starting point, getting a grid: display: grid;

Onto the columns, here‚Äôs how you make two columns ‚Äî each with a width of 100 pixels: grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;

Adding your gutters: grid-gap: 10px;

![](./grid-2.png)

Okay that‚Äôs nice and easy, but the units don‚Äôt always have to be pixels. In fact they could be ems, rems, or percentages. You can even use a mixture ‚Äî having each column using a different unit.

> # But wait, there‚Äôs more‚Ä¶ a new unit!

The grid spec is introducing the fraction unit; it‚Äôs used to denote using a fraction of the available space. For those familiar with flexbox, 1 fraction unit is just like using flex: 1;

So now to make your pixel width columns more flexible, you can change it up to: grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;

Writing out these column widths can get boring fast ‚Äî especially if they‚Äôre all the same width. Good thing there‚Äôs a new notation called repeat() üéâ

If we now want to increase to a four column width: grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);

![](./grid-3.png)

Alternatively, if you wanted to specify a column width of 100 pixels but you‚Äôd like as many columns as possible; you can use the keyword auto-fill. This will instruct the grid to use as many 100 pixel columns as possible like so: grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 100px);

Without going into too much more detail, another function that you‚Äôll likely find useful is minmax(). This allows you to specify a minimum width and a maximum width; which can be super useful at times.

## Some Intro Code on: Grid Placement

Each grid item can be placed at a specified location on any row or column and there are many ways this can be done. Using grid-row-start: 1; and grid-row-end: 2; you instruct the grid-item to start at the beginning of the first row, and end at the start of the second row. You can do the same for columns, and the grid will automatically re-shuffle to accommodate your rules.

Or you can just use the shorthand: grid-row: 1 / 2;

![](./grid-4.png)

There is an _even_ _shorter_ shorthand that simplifies down to ‚Äòrow start / column start / row end / column end‚Äô, this is: grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 2;

If you don‚Äôt want to specify where the item ends ‚Äî you can use the span keyword. This snippet would instruct an item to start at the beginning of the second row, and span two rows worth: grid-row: 2 / span 2;

## Some Fancy Code on: Grid Placement

When creating your rows and columns you are able to give them each a name, but I won‚Äôt go into that in this blog post. Instead I‚Äôll tell you about naming areas.

If in an example you used grid to layout a page, the grid container could be the wrapper and inside you‚Äôll have: a header, an aside, the main content, and a footer. If you give each of these items a class, you can then name them as grid areas like so: grid-area: header;

This can then be used in your grid container to visually create a layout using: grid-template-areas: "header header header"; This would specify that the ‚Äòheader‚Äô area should span 1 row and 3 columns. Each row is denoted by a pair of double quotes, and so creating a basic layout is as easy as:

![](./grid-5.png)

You might notice the empty space after the main content is denoted by using a period; this means no more fake empty columns or grid offsets! ‚ú®

Although take note that if you were to add any further grid items ‚Äî named or not ‚Äî they will automatically fill in the gaps.

This way of defining your structure is so powerful, especially as all of the grid code can be flipped and re-structured by media queries! üî•

## The Cool Bits

Now that we‚Äôve covered what grid is and how it can be used; I‚Äôll leave you to explore how to use it in more detail by yourself. Instead, I‚Äôll show you some cool examples to highlight where it can be used in your every-day projects.

![FireFox Dev Tools](./grid-6.png)_FireFox Dev Tools_

Good news for those of you that use FireFox! Currently out in the Developer Edition and Nightly ‚Äî you can click on a small icon next to your display: grid; in order to visualise your grid. How cool is that?!

![[Responsive Tables](http://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/PNwaZe)](./grid-7.png)_[Responsive Tables](http://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/PNwaZe)_

This is an example of a table that uses display: grid; and media queries to easily provide a responsive solution. The code is both clean and elegant, whilst allowing you to use tabular data in your markup. Here‚Äôs a link to the [codepen](http://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/PNwaZe).

![](./grid-8.png)

This is an example of a complex grid layout that can be done using the [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) grid architecture. Here it‚Äôs being done using the native CSS Grid spec ‚Äî showing just how powerful it can be! Here‚Äôs the codepen for the [Susy example](http://codepen.io/straybugs/pen/MKpgZd). While here‚Äôs the reference for the [Grid example](http://gridbyexample.com/examples/page-layout/#layout6).

![](./grid-9.png)

The grid items can also be affected by z-index, this opens up many opportunities for some cool structures.

![](./grid-10.png)

This example shows a specifically placed featured piece of content, with the rest of the cards automatically flowing around it.

![](./grid-11.png)

A very common pattern is a featured header section of a page. Rachel Andrew yet again shows an elegant solution to [building this responsively](http://gridbyexample.com/patterns/hero-image-panel/).
