A personal reference for WebGL shader terms. Feel free to get in touch if anything isn't clear or if there's something you would like to add.

## Terms

<dl>
    <dt>Normalizing</dt>
    <dd>Converting a value to be between 0.0 and 1.0. You can normalize the FragCoord by dividing it with by the canvas resolution</dd>    
</dl>

## Variables

_Note: when I say "between pixels" it's because a shader will perform its calculations on every individual pixel._

<dl>
    <dt>Uniform</dt>
    <dd>The same between pixels</dd>
    <dt>Varying</dt>
    <dd>Can be different between pixels</dd>
    <dt>FragColor</dt>
    <dd>The colour of the pixel being computed</dd>
    <dt>FragCoord</dt>
    <dd>The x and y value of the pixel being computed</dd>
</dl>
