[UPDATE: This is pre Webpack 2, it might be handled differently now]

The other day I was using the Google Maps API for some custom map work; and in order for that to work you are supplied a simple script tag to call it in with a callback that fires when itâ€™s loaded.

This is where I ran into problems with Webpack.

By nature, Webpack is a module bundler, and as such it wraps up all of your assets â€” serving it up with a nice little bow ðŸŽ€. A side-effect of this is that none your functions or variables can be accessed in the global scope. As such the Google Maps callback canâ€™t find my initMap() functionâ€¦

Okay so I may have spent far too long trawling Google but I have found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Hereâ€™s how to get this all sorted:

You can use exports. There are a hundred different ways to do this but my preference is to use the ES6 syntax as best explained in this [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export). However this alone doesnâ€™t expose your functionality, it just makes it known to Webpack. In order to finish this procedure you need to make a small tweak to your Webpack config.

[This section](https://webpack.github.io/docs/library-and-externals.html) of the Webpack documentation explains that you need to name your library, and specify the method you are using for exports. Seeing as Iâ€™m using ES6 I can leave out LibraryTarget as it expects this method by default.

Now that this is done, the function I exported can be accessed by calling it via `app.initMap`.

Great, right?! This is where everything broke.

So hereâ€™s a little gotcha that I discovered: it turns out that Webpack only exports items from the **_last _**entry point [in your config](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#entry).

Simple solution though, Iâ€™ve got a main index file that pulls in all of the functionality of my app and exports it accordingly. Luckily my project is only a small build so I donâ€™t have any major problems with this. The **_real_** solution would be to use [code-splitting](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html).
